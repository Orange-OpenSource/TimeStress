# verb-tools

A library to verbalize facts (in the form of triples) into natural language using templates. Many aspects of the verbalization are controlled:
- The tense used in the sentence
- The temporal context (e.g., date, period)
- Many paraphrases

The available templates are:
- WikiFactDiff Verbalizer (>1000 relations supported, many paraphrases per relation)
- ParaRel Verbalizer (39 relations supported, high quality templates + paraphrases)
